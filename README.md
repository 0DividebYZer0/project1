## Project Description
The game is based on the idea of treasure hunt using the Google Map API.  The target audience for this game is anyone old enough to read and use a computer.  This is a one player  game where the location and the hidden object are provided by the game (computer). The user controls the game by using the mouse and clicking on the map with the goal of finding the hidden object. The hidden object is placed in a specific location/radius provided by the game.  The map presented to the user also provides a series of clues such as: “The object is hidden 5 miles from the Starbuck in Union Square”.  The user by clicking on the map is given more clues  as to being on the right track or not.  The player must find the object before a timer runs out. Once the timer is up the round is over and the user losses. If the location is found before the timer runs out the user wins. At the end of each round, the hidden object and location  is revealed to the user. The user is then given the option to start another round. At the end of five rounds the game is over. A score table provides the wins or loss of the user per round.
